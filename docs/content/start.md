# Initial commit

Welcome to the **React Template** documentation. In this page you will find the instructions for the initial commit.

---

## Create the repository using this template

## Clear & Customize

There are several places where mock data, and placeholders are used.
Update them to fit your project:

- Docs
    - `content/*`.
    - `index.html` -> title, favicon, and `window.$docsify = {...}`.
- Project
    - `package.json` -> name
    - `LICENSE` -> **raulvalverdeleal** username
    - `index.html` -> title & favicon
    - `.env.*` -> VITE_API_ROOT
    - `@/utils/symbols.ts` -> contact info & social links
    - `README.md`

?> _TODO:_ Make `bin/setup.js` script that guides the developer through the setup journey.

## Commit

That’s it, you’re ready to go!

```bash
git commit -am "Initial commit"

```
