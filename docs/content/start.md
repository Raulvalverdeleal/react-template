# React template

This is a **ready-to-use React starter** built with **Vite**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **shadcn UI**.  
It comes pre-configured with modern tooling and utilities to speed up development of scalable React applications.

## Key Features

- Clean project structure with `@hooks`, `@components`, and `@services` aliases.
- Built-in **multilanguage support**.
- Responsive layout with `Header → Main → Footer` and smooth transitions.
- Centralized **error handling** (Error Boundary + global `onError`).
- Environment-specific configurations: `local`, `pre`, `prod`.
- Browser router with page configuration. (`secured`, `headerVisible`...)
- Handy utilities: dates, fetch wrappers, intervals, cookies, and more.
- Icon system via a single `icons.svg`.
- Framework-agnostic **core classes** for the bussiness logic.

## Getting started

### 1 Create a repository using this template

- 1.1 Go to the repository page by clicking on the top-right link.
- 1.2 Click on the **"Use this template"** green button ans select **Create a new repository**.
- 1.3 Mark **Include all branches** wether you want to add docs to your project or not.
- 1.4 Complete the rest of the fields as in any other repository.

### 2 Clone your new repository & launch

- 2.1 Clone the repo you've created by one of the three options github provides. (`https` `ssh` `GitHub CLI`)
- 2.2 Run the following commands to launch the repository in your local machine.

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

### 3 Clean up the traces of the React template.

- `package.json` -> name
- `LICENSE` -> **raulvalverdeleal** username
- `index.html` -> title & favicon
- `README.md`
- `docs` -> React template uses [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/?id=docsify) for its documentation. As you are using this template, you can just extend this documentation by adding your hooks, services, components to the corresponding pages.

### 4 Commit

That’s it, you’re ready to go!

```bash
git commit -am "Initial commit"
git push
```
